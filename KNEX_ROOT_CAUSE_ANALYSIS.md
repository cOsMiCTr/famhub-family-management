# Knex Deployment - Root Cause Analysis (NO DEPLOYMENT)

## 🔍 Investigation Complete

### ✅ What's Working

1. **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ WORKING
   - Migrations compile: `dist/database/migrations/*.js` ✅
   - Seeds compile: `dist/database/seeds/*.js` ✅
   - knexfile compiles: `dist/database/knexfile.js` ✅

2. **Path Resolution**: ✅ CORRECT
   - `knexfile.js` uses `__dirname` which resolves to `dist/database` in production
   - Migration directory: `dist/database/migrations`
   - Seeds directory: `dist/database/seeds`

3. **Production Script**: ✅ EXISTS
   - `migrate:latest:prod` script exists in package.json
   - Correctly uses compiled files: `dist/database/knexfile.js`

---

## ❌ THE PROBLEM: Procfile Uses Wrong Script

### Current Procfile (BROKEN):
```
release: npm run migrate:latest
```

### What `migrate:latest` Actually Does:
```bash
ts-node -r dotenv/config node_modules/.bin/knex migrate:latest --knexfile src/database/knexfile.ts
```

**Issues:**
1. ❌ Uses `ts-node` (TypeScript runtime) - not needed/available with compiled JS
2. ❌ Points to `src/database/knexfile.ts` - **THIS FILE DOESN'T EXIST** after `npm run build`
3. ❌ Source files (`src/`) are not deployed to Heroku, only compiled files (`dist/`)
4. ❌ Release phase fails because it can't find `src/database/knexfile.ts`

### What Should Happen:
```
release: npm run migrate:latest:prod
```

**Which runs:**
```bash
node -r dotenv/config node_modules/.bin/knex migrate:latest --knexfile dist/database/knexfile.js
```

**This works because:**
1. ✅ Uses `node` (normal JavaScript execution)
2. ✅ Points to `dist/database/knexfile.js` (file exists after build)
3. ✅ Uses compiled files that are actually deployed

## 📊 Evidence

### Files Verified:
```bash
✅ dist/database/knexfile.js                    # Compiled config exists
✅ dist/database/migrations/0000000000000_initial_schema.js  # Migration exists
✅ dist/database/migrations/0000000000001_create_indexes.js   # Migration exists
✅ dist/database/seeds/01_currencies.js         # Seed exists
✅ All other seeds...                            # All compiled
```

### Path Resolution in Compiled knexfile.js:
```javascript
const baseDir = __dirname;  // Will be dist/database in production
const migrationsDir = path.join(baseDir, 'migrations');  // dist/database/migrations
const seedsDir = path.join(baseDir, 'seeds');           // dist/database/seeds
```

✅ **This is correct** - paths resolve properly in production

---

## 🎯 The Fix (When Ready to Deploy)

### One Line Change in Procfile:

**From:**
```
release: npm run migrate:latest
```

**To:**
```
release: npm run migrate:latest:prod
```

That's it! All other components are correct.

---

## 🔧 Secondary Considerations

### If Database Already Has Migration Entries

After fixing Procfile, if the database already has entries in `knex_migrations` table with `.ts` extensions:

**Option 1: Fix database entries**
```bash
heroku run node scripts/fix-migration-names.js
```

**Option 2: Clear and restart (ONLY if safe)**
```sql
DELETE FROM knex_migrations;
```

### Migration Safety Check

The migration file has a safety check:
```typescript
const usersTableExists = await knex.schema.hasTable('users');
if (usersTableExists) {
  console.log('⚠️  Tables already exist. Skipping schema creation.');
  return;
}
```

✅ This prevents trying to create existing tables - safe for existing databases

## 📋 Deployment Checklist (When Ready)

- [x] ✅ Verified migrations compile correctly
- [x] ✅ Verified knexfile.js exists in dist/
- [x] ✅ Verified production script exists
- [x] ✅ Verified path resolution is correct
- [ ] **TODO**: Update Procfile to `migrate:latest:prod`
- [ ] **TODO**: Test locally: `npm run build && npm run migrate:latest:prod`
- [ ] **TODO**: Check for existing migration entries in database
- [ ] **TODO**: Deploy and monitor release phase

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Root Cause**: Procfile uses development script (`migrate:latest`) instead of production script (`migrate:latest:prod`)

**Impact**: Release phase fails because it tries to load `src/database/knexfile.ts` which doesn't exist after build

**Solution**: Change one line in Procfile

**Status**: ✅ Ready to fix (just change Procfile)

**Risk**: Very low - all other components are working correctly

## 📝 Files Analyzed

- ✅ `Procfile` - Identified as the issue
- ✅ `package.json` - Production script exists and is correct
- ✅ `src/database/knexfile.ts` - Configuration is correct
- ✅ `dist/database/knexfile.js` - Compiled version verified
- ✅ `dist/database/migrations/*.js` - All migrations compiled
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` - Compilation config is correct
- ✅ Migration files have safety checks for existing tables

**Conclusion**: Everything is set up correctly except for the Procfile script selection.
