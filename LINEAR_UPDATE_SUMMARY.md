## Current Work in Progress

### External Users Linking System
**Status**: Planning complete, ready to implement
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Large (multiple phases)

## Technical Debt / Improvements Needed

1. **Email Uniqueness Validation**: 
   - Need to ensure strict email uniqueness during user creation
   - Need to check for external person matches after user creation

2. **Notification Infrastructure**: 
   - User-facing notifications system needs to be built (currently only admin notifications exist)
   - Future email notification infrastructure needs to be prepared

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Query optimization for shared data filtering
   - Index optimization for invitation and connection queries

## Planned Next Steps

1. **Implement External Users Linking System** (New Plan)
   - Phase 1: Database migrations (4 migrations)
   - Phase 2: Backend services (3 services)
   - Phase 3: Backend routes (3 route files)
   - Phase 4: Frontend components (6 components/pages)
   - Phase 5: Background jobs (expiry cron)
   - Phase 6: Translations
   - Phase 7: Testing

2. **Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - Add income external person linking (if needed)
   - Email notification system integration
   - Advanced filtering UI improvements
