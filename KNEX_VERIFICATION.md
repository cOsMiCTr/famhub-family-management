# Knex Migration System - Verification Status

## Current Status: ✅ **YES, WE ARE ON KNEX!**

## Verification Points

### 1. Release Phase ✅
The latest deployment (v404) successfully completed with:
```
> migrate:latest:prod
> node -r dotenv/config node_modules/.bin/knex migrate:latest --knexfile dist/database/knexfile.js

Working directory changed to ~/dist/database
Using environment: production
Already up to date
Waiting for release.... done.
```

**This confirms:**
- ✅ Knex is running in release phase
- ✅ Using compiled production files (`dist/database/knexfile.js`)
- ✅ Migrations are being checked (shows "Already up to date" means migrations are tracked)

### 2. Application Startup ✅
The application starts and skips migrations on startup (because they're handled in release phase):
```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  await db.migrate.latest();
} else {
  console.log('✅ Skipping migrations (handled by release phase in production)');
}
```

### 3. Old Migration System ⚠️
The old `runMigrations()` function is still in `database.ts` but:
- ❌ **NOT being called** in production
- ⚠️ Only called in development if migrations fail
- 🔄 Can be removed after confidence period

### 4. Database Tracking
The `knex_migrations` table exists and tracks:
- Which migrations have been applied
- Migration batch numbers
- Timestamps

## What Changed

### Before (Old System):
- `runMigrations()` function with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Migrations run on every app startup
- No migration tracking/versioning
- No rollback capability

### Now (Knex System):
- ✅ Knex migration files in `src/database/migrations/`
- ✅ Migrations run in Heroku release phase
- ✅ Migration tracking in `knex_migrations` table
- ✅ Rollback support with `down()` functions
- ✅ Versioned migrations (can see which are applied)

## Files Confirming Knex Usage

1. ✅ `Procfile` - Uses `migrate:latest:prod`
2. ✅ `src/database/knexfile.ts` - Knex configuration
3. ✅ `src/database/migrations/*.ts` - Migration files
4. ✅ `src/database/seeds/*.ts` - Seed files
5. ✅ `package.json` - Has Knex scripts
6. ✅ `src/config/database.ts` - Uses `db.migrate.latest()` (in dev)

## Migration Status

Run this to check:
```bash
heroku run npm run migrate:status:prod
```

Expected output shows which migrations are applied.

## Summary

🎉 **YES - The application is now fully migrated to Knex.js migration system!**

- ✅ Release phase uses Knex
- ✅ Migrations are tracked in database
- ✅ Production deployment works
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Future migrations will use Knex automatically

The old `runMigrations()` function can eventually be removed after a confidence period, but it's not being used in production.
