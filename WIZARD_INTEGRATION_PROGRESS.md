# Expense Wizard Integration Progress

## âœ… Completed Steps

1. âœ… Created all category-specific forms:
   - ExpenseInsuranceForm
   - ExpenseSubscriptionForm  
   - ExpenseSchoolForm
   - Enhanced ExpenseGiftForm (with external persons)
   - Enhanced ExpenseBillForm (with subcategory selector)
   - Enhanced ExpenseTaxForm (with subcategory selector)

2. âœ… Updated ExpenseCategoryForm to include all new category types

3. âœ… Fixed ExpenseInsuranceForm to properly handle asset and member linking

4. âœ… All forms compile successfully

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Integration

### Step 1: Import Wizard in ExpensesPage
- Add import statement for `AddEditExpenseWizard`

### Step 2: Replace Modal with Wizard
- Remove existing modal JSX (lines 943-1180)
- Replace with `<AddEditExpenseWizard>` component
- Pass required props: isOpen, onClose, onSave, expense, categories, members

### Step 3: Create handleWizardSave Function
- Wrap existing handleSubmit logic
- Format data for API
- Handle both create and update

### Step 4: Update handleEdit Function  
- Format expense data for wizard format
- Include metadata and custom form data

### Step 5: Update handleAdd Click
- Use wizard instead of showAddModal

## Notes

- Wizard already loads insurance suggestions and external persons internally
- Wizard expects categories in hierarchical format (with subcategories)
- Wizard's onSave receives formatted expenseData object
